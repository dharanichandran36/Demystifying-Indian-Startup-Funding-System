# Demystifying-Indian-Startup-Funding-System
India has emerged as the third largest startup ecosystem in the world after the US and China and the pace of growth is not showing any signs of slowing down. The ecosystem has expanded rapidly, mainly through private investments including seed, angel, venture capital, and private equity, along with technical support from incubators/accelerators, and public policy.
This Project focuses on finding any patterns in Startup funding which will help the upcoming startups to make decisions that favour them the most. Here various machine learning techniques i.e Regression (Multiple linear regression and Elastic Net Regression) techniques are used to find the amount to be expected given the Industry, location and other parameters.
